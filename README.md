About SADE
==========

The Scalable Architecture for Digital Editions (SADE) tries to meet the requirement for an easy to use publication system for electronic resources and Digital Editions. It is an attempt to provide a modular concept for publishing scholarly editions in a digital medium, based on open standards. Furthermore it is a distribution of open source software tools for the easy publication of Digital Editions and digitized texts in general out of the box. SADE is a scalable system that can be adapted by different projects which follow the TEI guidelines or other XML based formats.
